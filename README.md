# The Ungodly Crawl

This project was created in the short span of 3 weeks to for a final project in an elective Interactive Media I class.
It functions as a game in-browser, using a small set of events to build up the player's stats and a fighting system
for bossfights and a few events in the second area. One playthrough of the game can last anywhere from 1 - 20 min, though
it can get repetitive due to it's somewhat low amount of events.

## How to play

Assemble all the files into one folder, and launch index.html in your browser of choice. Nothing special to it. The game's
instructions are fully detailed within the page.

## Current Issues

Documents are largely unorganized at the current moment. Seperating them into their own folders requires editing all the
various calls in the javascript, which will be done at some point.

There are no known issues with gameplay as of yet.
